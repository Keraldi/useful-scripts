# useful-scripts
A random collection of random (useful) scripts and configurations for random purposes.

(That will hopefully grow over time, feel free to contribute! :D)

Feel free to drop a PR if you want to add scripts that you think have a place here or improve existing ones.  
Feel free to file an issue requesting small scripts that could be useful in frequent situations.  

Please file an issue if a script does not work or you have a suggestion to improve existing ones.
